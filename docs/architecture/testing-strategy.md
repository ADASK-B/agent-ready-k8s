# Testing Strategy

> **⚠️ STATUS: DRAFT - Phase 2 work**
>
> This document will define our testing approach once we begin backend/frontend development in Phase 2+.
> **Action Required:** Populate with specific tooling (pytest, k6, Playwright) and quality gates when implementing Phase 2 features.

---

## Purpose

This document will define our testing approach once we begin backend/frontend development in Phase 2+.

---

## Planned Scope

When this strategy is finalized, it will cover:

| Area | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Test Pyramid** | Distribution: 60% unit, 30% integration, 10% E2E | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| **Unit Tests** | Tooling (pytest/Jest), coverage goals (≥80%) | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| **Integration Tests** | Testcontainers strategy for PostgreSQL/Redis | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| **E2E Tests** | Playwright for user journeys, critical paths | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| **Performance Tests** | k6 load testing, P95 latency targets | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| **Security Tests** | Trivy/Snyk/GitLeaks, CVE policies | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| **CI/CD Gates** | Merge criteria, deployment approval rules | 🔜 Phase 2 |

---

## Prerequisites

Before finalizing this strategy, we need:

- Backend API implementation
- Frontend application code
- Test frameworks installed (pytest, Jest, Testcontainers)
- CI/CD pipeline established
