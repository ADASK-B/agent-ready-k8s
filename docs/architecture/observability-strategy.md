# Observability Strategy

> **⚠️ STATUS: DRAFT - Phase 2 work**
>
> This document will define our observability stack (metrics, logging, tracing) for Phase 2+ production deployments.
> **Action Required:** Populate with concrete stack details (Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, Grafana dashboards) when implementing Phase 2 features.

---

## Purpose

This document will define our observability stack, metrics, logging, and alerting approach once we begin Phase 2+ work.

---

## Planned Scope

When this strategy is finalized, it will cover:

| Area | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Metrics** | Prometheus, Grafana, Golden Signals (RED method) | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| **Logging** | Loki, structured logs, retention policies | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| **Tracing** | Tempo, OpenTelemetry, distributed traces | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| **Dashboards** | SLO burn rate, certificate expiry, business metrics | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| **Alerting** | PagerDuty/Slack integration, severity levels | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| **SLOs/SLIs** | Availability, latency, error rate targets | 🔜 Phase 2 |

---

## Prerequisites

Before finalizing this strategy, we need:

- Backend services generating metrics
- Application logging framework
- Prometheus stack deployed
- Production workloads to monitor
