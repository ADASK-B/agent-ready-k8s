# Deployment Model

> **⚠️ STATUS: DRAFT - Phase 2 work**
>
> This document will describe our GitOps deployment patterns and environment strategy for Phase 2+ multi-environment deployments.
> **Action Required:** Flesh out sync policies, rollback strategies, and environment promotion workflows when implementing Phase 2 features.

---

## Purpose

This document will describe how applications and infrastructure are deployed using GitOps principles with Argo CD and Helm.

---

## Planned Scope

When this strategy is finalized, it will cover:

| Area | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **GitOps Principles** | Git as source of truth, declarative config, drift detection | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| **Argo CD Architecture** | App-of-apps pattern, sync waves, health checks | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| **Helm Strategy** | Chart structure, values hierarchy, environment overlays | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| **Sync Policies** | Auto-sync, self-heal, prune resources | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| **Environment Strategy** | dev/stage/prod promotion, approval gates | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| **Rollout Strategies** | Rolling updates, blue/green, canary | 🔜 Phase 2 |

---

## Prerequisites

Before finalizing this strategy, we need:

- Application Helm charts created
- Environment-specific values files
- Argo CD ApplicationSets defined
- Production promotion workflow
