# 🗺️ Roadmap - agent-ready-k8s

**Project Goal:** Build a scalable, AI-agent-friendly Kubernetes template stack with GitOps, Hot-Reload capabilities, and multi-tenant support.

---

## 📋 Phase 1: GitOps Transformation

**Goal:** Transform Phase 0's imperative Helm installs into declarative GitOps structure (Argo CD Applications).

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (All blocks finished, GitOps fully operational)

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-26

**Summary:**
- ✅ All infrastructure services (ingress-nginx, PostgreSQL, Redis, podinfo) migrated to Argo CD Applications
- ✅ GitOps workflows validated: Auto-Sync, Self-Heal, Drift Correction all working
- ✅ Zero Helm releases remaining (`helm list -A` returns empty)
- ✅ Git is now the single source of truth for cluster state
- ✅ Argo CD managing 4 applications (all Synced + Healthy)
- 📝 Note: `apps/podinfo/` Kustomize structure from Block 6 is unused (podinfo runs via Helm) - will be cleaned up in Phase 2 when Backend/Frontend replace test apps

### Block 1: Vendor Infrastructure Charts ✅
- [x] Vendor ingress-nginx Helm chart (v4.11.3)
  > Download ingress-nginx chart from official repo and store in helm-charts/infrastructure/ for self-contained, offline-ready deployments (Oracle/air-gapped compatibility)
- [x] Vendor PostgreSQL Helm chart (v16.2.4)
  > Download PostgreSQL chart from Bitnami and store locally - required for backend database without external dependencies
- [x] Vendor Redis Helm chart (v20.5.0)
  > Download Redis chart from Bitnami and store locally - required for Hot-Reload Pub/Sub and caching without external dependencies
- [x] Verify all charts stored in helm-charts/infrastructure/
  > Confirm all 4 charts (ingress-nginx, postgresql, redis, podinfo) are present with Chart.yaml and values.yaml files
- [x] Commit vendored charts
  > Git commit all vendored charts so Argo CD Applications can reference them from the repository

### Block 2: Create GitOps Folder Structure ✅
- [x] Create clusters/base/ directory structure
  > Create provider-agnostic cluster configuration folders (ingress-nginx, policies, storage) - base configs shared across all environments
- [x] Create clusters/overlays/kind/ directory
  > Create local development overlay for kind-specific configurations (port mappings, local storage)
- [x] Create apps/base/ directory
  > Create folder for Argo CD Application manifests - these define what gets deployed and how
- [x] Create argocd/bootstrap/ directory
  > Create folder for root Application (App-of-Apps pattern) - used in Phase 2+ for automated deployments
- [x] Create argocd/projects/ directory
  > Create folder for Argo CD AppProjects - used in Phase 2+ for multi-tenant isolation and RBAC
- [x] Commit folder structure
  > Git commit the new folder structure to match README.md architecture

### Block 3: Create Argo CD Applications ✅
- [x] Create apps/base/ingress-nginx-app.yaml
  > Define Argo CD Application pointing to vendored ingress-nginx chart (path: helm-charts/infrastructure/ingress-nginx)
- [x] Create apps/base/postgresql-app.yaml
  > Define Argo CD Application pointing to vendored PostgreSQL chart with same credentials as Phase 0 (demouser/demopass/demodb)
- [x] Create apps/base/redis-app.yaml
  > Define Argo CD Application pointing to vendored Redis chart with same password as Phase 0 (redispass)
- [x] Create apps/base/podinfo-app.yaml
  > Define Argo CD Application pointing to vendored podinfo chart with 2 replicas, Redis connection, demo.localhost ingress
- [x] Commit Application manifests
  > Git commit all 4 Application YAML files - these are the declarative deployment instructions for GitOps
- [x] Push all changes to GitHub
  > Push to GitHub so Argo CD can sync from the repository (CRITICAL: must be in Git before applying!)

### Block 4: GitOps Migration (Helm → Argo CD) ✅
- [x] Delete Helm release: ingress-nginx
  > Remove imperative Helm install from Phase 0 - Argo CD will recreate it declaratively
- [x] Delete Helm release: postgresql
  > Remove imperative Helm install from Phase 0 - Argo CD will recreate it declaratively
- [x] Delete Helm release: redis
  > Remove imperative Helm install from Phase 0 - Argo CD will recreate it declaratively
- [x] Delete Helm release: podinfo
  > Remove imperative Helm install from Phase 0 - Argo CD will recreate it declaratively
- [x] Apply Argo CD Application: ingress-nginx
  > Deploy ingress-nginx via Argo CD Application (kubectl apply -f apps/base/ingress-nginx-app.yaml)
- [x] Apply Argo CD Application: postgresql
  > Deploy PostgreSQL via Argo CD Application (kubectl apply -f apps/base/postgresql-app.yaml)
- [x] Apply Argo CD Application: redis
  > Deploy Redis via Argo CD Application (kubectl apply -f apps/base/redis-app.yaml)
- [x] Apply Argo CD Application: podinfo
  > Deploy podinfo via Argo CD Application (kubectl apply -f apps/base/podinfo-app.yaml)
- [x] Wait for all Applications to sync
  > Monitor Argo CD syncing all 4 Applications from Git (watch kubectl get applications -n argocd)
  > **RESOLVED:** Made repository public - all Applications now syncing successfully
- [x] Verify all Applications show Synced + Healthy status
  > Confirm all 4 Applications are green (Synced + Healthy) in Argo CD UI and CLI
  > **COMPLETE:** All 4 apps Synced + Healthy (fixed image tag issue with 'latest')

### Block 5: Validate GitOps Workflow ✅
- [x] Test auto-sync (modify podinfo replicas in Git)
  > Change replicas 2→3 in apps/base/podinfo-app.yaml, commit, push - verify Argo CD auto-syncs and creates 3 pods (proves git push → cluster updates works)
  > **COMPLETE:** Scaled to 3 replicas via Git commit, Argo CD synced, then reverted back to 2
- [x] Test self-heal (manually delete a pod)
  > Manually delete a podinfo pod with kubectl - verify Argo CD recreates it automatically within 30s (proves cluster drift correction works)
  > **COMPLETE:** Deleted pod, Argo CD recreated it immediately
- [x] Test drift correction (manually scale deployment)
  > Manually scale podinfo to 5 replicas with kubectl - verify Argo CD corrects back to 3 replicas (proves Git is source of truth)
  > **COMPLETE:** Manually scaled to 5, Argo CD self-healed back to 3 instantly
- [x] Verify helm list -A returns empty
  > Confirm no Helm releases exist anymore (helm list -A shows nothing) - all infrastructure now managed by Argo CD
  > **COMPLETE:** helm list -A shows 0 releases
- [x] Verify all 4 Applications synced in Argo CD
  > Check kubectl get applications -n argocd shows 4 apps, all Synced + Healthy
  > **COMPLETE:** All 4 apps Synced + Healthy (ingress-nginx, postgresql, redis, podinfo)
- [x] Test podinfo HTTP endpoint (http://demo.localhost)
  > Curl http://demo.localhost and verify podinfo responds with JSON (proves services still working after migration)
  > **COMPLETE:** Podinfo responding with version 6.9.2, message "GitOps Demo App"
- [x] Test Argo CD UI (http://argocd.local)
  > Login to Argo CD UI and verify all 4 Applications are green (Synced + Healthy) with correct pod counts
  > **SKIPPED:** CLI validation sufficient for Phase 1

### Block 6: Migrate Tenant Overlays (Flux → Kustomize) ✅
- [x] Analyze current apps/podinfo/ structure
  > Identified old Flux HelmRelease artifacts in apps/podinfo/tenants/demo/ requiring migration to Kustomize
  > **COMPLETE:** Base structure already exists (deployment.yaml, service.yaml, hpa.yaml, kustomization.yaml)
- [x] Create apps/podinfo/base/ Kustomize structure
  > Base already exists with deployment.yaml, service.yaml, hpa.yaml - generic manifests without tenant-specific config
  > **COMPLETE:** Verified base manifests are properly structured
- [x] Create apps/podinfo/base/kustomization.yaml
  > Base kustomization.yaml already exists, defines resources: [hpa.yaml, deployment.yaml, service.yaml]
  > **COMPLETE:** Base kustomization validated
- [x] Create apps/podinfo/tenants/demo/ingress.yaml (separate resource)
  > Created standalone Ingress file (moved from patch.yaml) - patchesStrategicMerge can't create new resources
  > **COMPLETE:** ingress.yaml created with demo.localhost host, nginx ingressClassName, podinfo service backend
- [x] Update apps/podinfo/tenants/demo/kustomization.yaml
  > Changed from deprecated 'patchesStrategicMerge' to modern 'patches:' syntax with target selector
  > **COMPLETE:** Added ingress.yaml to resources, switched to patches with target: Deployment/podinfo
- [x] Update apps/podinfo/tenants/demo/patch.yaml
  > Removed Ingress definition, kept only Deployment replica patch (replicas: 2)
  > **COMPLETE:** Patch now only contains Deployment spec.replicas modification
- [x] Validate tenant overlay builds
  > Run: kubectl kustomize apps/podinfo/tenants/demo - verify no errors, Ingress appears in output
  > **COMPLETE:** Build successful, generates Service + Deployment (2 replicas) + HPA + Ingress (demo.localhost)
- [x] Test tenant overlay on cluster (optional)
  > Skipped - current deployment uses HELM chart (apps/base/podinfo-app.yaml), Kustomize overlay ready for Phase 2+
  > **SKIPPED:** Not needed, overlay validated via kustomize build
- [x] Commit Kustomize-based tenant structure
  > Git commit cleaned-up tenant overlays - ready for multi-tenancy (Oracle Cloud, Phase 2+)
  > **COMPLETE:** All changes committed (ingress.yaml created, kustomization.yaml + patch.yaml updated)
